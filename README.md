# dccs

The daycare center system API for Java.



# Description

Dccs is a software application interface designed to store and manage data related to daycare centers. These organizations often work on a paper based system resulting in loss of information, limited decision making, financial loss, etc. This API will allow daycare centers to make more informed decisions, forecast future numbers based on historical data, schedule fun and educational activities, etc.

This tool can also be used across a variety of institutions to provide accurate, reliable information for decision making purposes. Businesses today spend lots of money on information systems to gain a competitive advantage. Dccs will provide similar benefits albeit on a much smaller scale for educators to teach, monitor, track and view learner progress.
